# SDTM Oncology Domains

This directory stores oncology-focused SDTM domains generated by the hybrid SAS–R pipeline, including:

- **TU**: Tumor Identification records for target and non-target lesions.
- **TR**: Tumor Results for lesion measurements across visits.
- **DS**: Disposition data used for survival event capture.

The SAS ETL programs in `etl/sas` write domain outputs here, and the R QC scripts read from the same location for parity checks.
