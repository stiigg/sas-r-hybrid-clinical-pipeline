Holds example input and derived data sets for the hybrid clinical pipeline.
Folders mirror the typical SDTM/ADaM lifecycle.

| `data/raw/` | Raw EDC extracts or vendor deliverables. |
| `data/sdtm/` | SDTM domains produced by the ETL step. |
| `data/adam/` | ADaM data sets produced by the ETL step. |

Generated data should be treated as transient; retain only representative input
files required for documentation or testing.
