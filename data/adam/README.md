# ADaM Oncology Datasets

This directory stores oncology analysis datasets generated by SAS programs in `etl/sas`.

Expected outputs include the core oncology structures:
- **ADTR**: Lesion-level tumor assessments with percent change from baseline.
- **ADRS**: Timepoint response classifications per RECIST 1.1.
- **ADEFFSUM**: Best Overall Response summary with confirmation logic.
- **ADTTE**: Time-to-event endpoints such as PFS and OS.
- **ADBM**: Biomarker analysis datasets (e.g., PD-L1, TMB, MSI).

R-based QC utilities under `qc/r` read these files for double-programming checks.
